# Wireshark Profiles

A collection of Wireshark profiles I've developed over time while frequently troubleshooting, and analzying network protocols.

## Features

These profiles aim to save time by applying some common configurations, and protocol specific customizations. In general, they include:

- The preferred split layout
- Protocol specific columns
- Quick filter buttons 
- Useful I/O graph presets
- Mostly default coloring rules
- Mostly default "decode as" rules
- A few other basic configs
